# A very minimal, basic dotnet web app

<p>Project in progress</p>

<p>I am working on some coding challenges in different languages.  One of those is C#/.NETcore.  Until now, I've been using only a C# console app because the challenges are small.</p>
<p>However, most of the other languages are web languages using some form of JavaScript framework.  To try and keep things consistent, I decided I needed to do C# in a web app form. But, I don't like most of the C# web templage types.  Microsoft is too fond of 'bloatware', in my view.</p>
<p>This repo is the result of several attempts to minimize the MVC web app to a much smaller version.  There is still a good bit to do and commenting is needed.  But, I have managed to reduce things quite a bit.</p>
<p>Please read through the comments I am adding in various places throughout the app to help understand how things are working here as opposed to a standar MVC app.</p>

<p>Very important to note: MVC Views do not use "@page" or any other header directives.  They open with "@{ }""</p>

### Do not confuse Views with Razor Pages
